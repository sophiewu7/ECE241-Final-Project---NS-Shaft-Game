# ECE241-Final-Project---NS-Shaft-Game

#· In a team of two, built a video game similar to NS-Shaft using Verilog with an FPGA board, a PS2
#keyboard, a VGA adaptor and a monitor as the final project for ECE241 (Digital Systems).
#· Through three weeks of work, we have successfully build a video game where a player (snowman)
#can jump down three different types of randomly moving (both speed and position) platforms to
#reach the 30th level (every 5 platforms count as 1 level) to win the game.
